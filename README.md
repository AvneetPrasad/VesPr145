- 👋 Hi, I’m @VesPr145
- 👀 I’m interested in robotics and automation
- 🌱 I’m currently studying mechatronic engineering
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cool personal projects

I am currently in my fourth year of Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) majoring in Mechatronic Engineering. I am striving to seek out opportunities that will enable me to challenge myself and grow as a passionate engineer. Something that I believe is that there is always more room to learn more things. I chose my minor and major in order to give myself the opportunity to get a in depth skills and knowledge on engineering as well as improve my critical and creative thinking. My passion is robotics and automation. I plan on using these to make the future more sustainable and easier to live in while improving the lifestyle for people all over the world. I have experience in Python, Java, C, C# and C++. I also have experience in 3D printing, 3D design, design methodology and electronics.

I always like to keep myself busy wherever I am at home I usually tinker around with arduino. In my spare time I like to go on Lynda.com and do some courses that I find interesting which I think would come in useful. I love learning from other people such as friends because it helps me understand their point of view on approaching problems.

I am extremely lucky to be in a time where there are so many people that motivate and influence me to push my skills to the limit. One of which is Elon Musk as he and his company create many unique technological advances. I wish to learn more about robotics and improve on my understanding on mechatronic systems.
